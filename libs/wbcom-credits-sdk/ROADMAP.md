# Wbcom Credits SDK — Roadmap

## v1.2.0 (Current) — Direct Payment Gateways

**Shipped:**
- `Abstract_Gateway` base — every new gateway is ~150 lines of provider-specific code; idempotency, amount/currency cross-check, top-up, refund accounting, `Transaction_Log` writes are inherited.
- `Stripe` gateway — Stripe Checkout, signature verify (inline HMAC), full + partial refunds.
- `PayPal` gateway — PayPal Orders v2, verify-API signature check, full + partial refunds.
- `Transaction_Log` table — per-gateway audit trail with parent/refund linkage.
- `Idempotency` (FIFO ring) + `Pending_Checkouts` (TTL-pruned amount cross-check) + `Signature_Verifier` (Stripe HMAC + PayPal verify-API).
- `Webhook_Controller` REST routes: `/{slug}/checkout/{gw}`, `/{slug}/webhook/{gw}`, `/{slug}/refund/{gw}`.
- 23 unit tests covering idempotency, signature verification, and pending-checkout pruning.

**Action hooks for consuming plugins:**
- `wbcom_credits_gateway_topup` — fires after a successful direct-pay top-up.
- `wbcom_credits_gateway_refund` — fires after credits have been revoked from a refund.
- `wbcom_credits_register_gateways` — third-party gateways register here.

**Out of scope (deferred to v1.3):**
- Subscriptions (Stripe Subscriptions, PayPal Billing Subscriptions).
- One-click "Connect" onboarding (Stripe Connect / PayPal Partner Referrals) — see v1.3 below.

---

## v1.3 (Next) — One-Click Connect Onboarding

**Goal:** site owner clicks "Connect Stripe" or "Connect PayPal", does the OAuth dance once, and the SDK takes care of everything else. No copying API keys. No webhook URL hand-configuration. Works on the same Wbcom Connect platform across every plugin that bundles the SDK.

**Components:**
- **Wbcom Connect platform** — single hosted endpoint at `connect.wbcomdesigns.com` that brokers OAuth for every consuming plugin. Redirects back to the site with a code; site exchanges via SDK.
- **Stripe Connect** — Standard accounts. SDK ships the platform `client_id`, the site never registers anything with Stripe directly.
- **PayPal Partner Referrals** — equivalent flow.
- **Webhook auto-registration** — once connected, the SDK calls the provider API to create the webhook endpoint with the right URL pointing back at the site, so admins never paste signing secrets.

**Estimated effort:** 5 days SDK + 2 days platform infra.

---

## v1.0 — Launch Ready

**Payment via existing commerce/membership plugins:**
- WooCommerce (one-time products)
- WooCommerce Subscriptions (recurring)
- WooCommerce Memberships
- Paid Memberships Pro
- MemberPress

**Strategy:** Leverage battle-tested plugins the site owner already has. No direct gateway integration needed. Covers 95%+ of WordPress monetization scenarios.

---

## v1.1 (Past) — Reusable Templates + Direct Gateway Support

> **Status:** Part A (templates) shipped in 1.1.0. Part B (Stripe + PayPal direct gateways) shipped in 1.2.0 — see top of this file.

### Part A: Reusable Admin + Frontend Templates (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Problem:** Every consuming plugin currently rebuilds the same admin Credits tab, Transactions page, and dashboard Credits tab from scratch. When the SDK adds a new feature (Stripe gateway, subscription renewal display), every plugin has to update independently — they diverge, drift, and bugs multiply.

**Solution:** Ship reusable templates inside the SDK that consuming plugins include with a single function call.

```

#### Loader API

```php
namespace Wbcom\Credits;

class Template {
    public static function get( string $name, array $args = array(), string $plugin_slug = '' ): void;
    public static function locate( string $name, string $plugin_slug = '' ): string;
}
```

Precedence for template lookups:
1. `{theme}/wbcom-credits/{plugin_slug}/{name}.php` — plugin-specific override
2. `{theme}/wbcom-credits/{name}.php` — global override for all SDK-using plugins
3. `{sdk}/templates/{name}.php` — SDK default

#### CSS token system

Templates use CSS custom properties, not hardcoded classes:
```css
.wbcom-credits-balance-card {
    background: var(--wbcom-credits-accent, #2271b1);
    color: var(--wbcom-credits-accent-fg, #fff);
    border-radius: var(--wbcom-credits-radius, 8px);
}
```

Consuming plugins set tokens to match their brand colors. Same template, different look per plugin.

#### Consuming plugin integration (10-line admin tab instead of 600)

```php
add_action( '{prefix}_settings_tab_content', function ( $tab ) {
    if ( 'credits' !== $tab ) return;
    \Wbcom\Credits\Template::get( 'admin/credits-tab', array(
        'slug'      => 'my-plugin',
        'prefix'    => 'mp',
        'consumers' => \Wbcom\Credits\Registry::instance()->get( 'my-plugin' )['consumers'],
    ), 'my-plugin' );
} );
```

#### Benefits

- SDK updates (new gateway, new adapter, new section) auto-propagate to all consuming plugins
- Zero UI code per plugin — consuming plugins only provide data
- Cross-plugin UI consistency guaranteed
- Theme developers can customize once, override applies to all SDK-using plugins
- New plugin adoption time drops from 2 days to 30 minutes
- Bug fixed in one template = fixed in all plugins

### Part B: Direct Gateway Support

Add native Stripe + PayPal gateways so sites without WooCommerce/PMPro/etc. can still sell credits.

### Why

- Many site owners don't want to install WooCommerce just to sell credits
- Direct gateway = simpler checkout (hosted Stripe Checkout / PayPal page)
- Faster conversion (fewer steps than WC cart flow)
- Recurring subscriptions possible via Stripe Subscriptions API

### Scope

**1. StripeGateway (`src/Gateways/Stripe.php`)**

Implements `GatewayInterface` using Stripe Checkout API:
- One-time payments: `checkout.sessions.create` with `mode: 'payment'`
- Subscriptions: `checkout.sessions.create` with `mode: 'subscription'`
- Webhook events handled:
  - `checkout.session.completed` → `Credits::topup()` (one-time)
  - `invoice.payment_succeeded` → `Credits::topup()` (subscription renewal)
  - `customer.subscription.deleted` → optional action (notify user)
- Admin settings: test/live mode toggle, publishable key, secret key, webhook secret
- Price ID mapping: Stripe Price ID → credit amount (stored in `{slug}_stripe_mappings` option)
- Idempotency: track `checkout_session_id` on ledger entries to prevent duplicate topups

**2. PayPalGateway (`src/Gateways/PayPal.php`)**

Implements `GatewayInterface` using PayPal Orders API v2:
- One-time payments: `POST /v2/checkout/orders` with `intent: CAPTURE`
- Subscriptions: `POST /v1/billing/subscriptions` with plan ID
- Webhook events handled:
  - `CHECKOUT.ORDER.APPROVED` + `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED` → `Credits::topup()`
  - `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.PAYMENT.COMPLETED` → `Credits::topup()` (renewal)
- Admin settings: sandbox/live mode, client ID, secret, webhook ID
- Product mapping: PayPal Product/Plan ID → credit amount
- Idempotency: track `paypal_order_id` / `paypal_subscription_id`

**3. Admin UI for Direct Gateways**

Add "Payment Gateways" subsection to the consuming plugin's Credits admin page:
- Stripe section (collapsed by default):
  - Enable/disable toggle
  - Mode: Test / Live
  - Publishable Key, Secret Key, Webhook Secret
  - Webhook URL displayed (readonly, copyable): `/wp-json/wbcom-credits/v1/{slug}/stripe-webhook`
  - Credit packages table (Stripe Price ID → Credits)
  - Add Package form
- PayPal section (same structure)
- Detected Providers continues to show existing adapters

**4. REST Endpoints**

Add to SDK REST layer (`src/REST.php`):
- `POST /wbcom-credits/v1/{slug}/checkout/stripe` — create Stripe checkout session, return redirect URL
- `POST /wbcom-credits/v1/{slug}/checkout/paypal` — create PayPal order, return approval URL
- `POST /wbcom-credits/v1/{slug}/stripe-webhook` — receive Stripe events (signature-verified)
- `POST /wbcom-credits/v1/{slug}/paypal-webhook` — receive PayPal events (signature-verified)

**5. Frontend Integration**

Update SDK's Credits Purchase block to show gateway buttons when configured:
- "Pay with Stripe" button → POST to checkout endpoint → redirect to Stripe Checkout
- "Pay with PayPal" button → POST to checkout endpoint → redirect to PayPal approval
- Both hit `Credits::topup()` via webhook on success — exact same lifecycle as WC adapter

**6. Subscriptions Support (v1.2)**

Once one-time works, add recurring:
- Stripe Subscriptions API integration
- PayPal Billing Subscriptions API integration
- Admin UI: toggle per-package "Recurring" flag with interval (monthly/yearly)
- Webhook handlers for renewal events continue crediting user each cycle
- User dashboard shows active subscription + "Cancel" button

### Estimated Effort

| Component | Effort |
|-----------|--------|
| StripeGateway class | 1 day |
| PayPalGateway class | 1 day |
| Webhook signature verification | 0.5 day |
| Admin UI (price mappings) | 1 day |
| REST endpoints | 0.5 day |
| Frontend buttons | 0.5 day |
| Testing (Stripe test mode + PayPal sandbox) | 1 day |
| **Total** | **~5 days** |

### Dependencies

- `stripe/stripe-php` SDK (add via Composer or bundled)
- PayPal REST SDK or raw HTTP (lightweight: use `wp_remote_post`)

### Security Notes

- **Never** log full secret keys or webhook payloads
- Signature verification is **mandatory** before calling `Credits::topup()`
- Idempotency key per transaction (Stripe event ID, PayPal capture ID)
- Rate limit webhook endpoints (default WP REST rate limit is fine)

---

## v2.0 (Later) — Advanced Gateways

- **Razorpay** (for India market)
- **Paddle** (merchant of record — handles VAT)
- **Apple Pay / Google Pay** via Stripe
- **Coinbase Commerce** (crypto payments)

Each implements `GatewayInterface`, follows same pattern as v1.1.

---

## Implementation Notes for v1.1

When implementing, follow this order:

1. **Build StripeGateway first** (Stripe has cleaner API, better docs, easier webhooks)
2. **Test with real Stripe test mode** before starting PayPal
3. **Extract common patterns** (idempotency, webhook verification, mapping lookup) into a base class `AbstractGateway`
4. **Then PayPal** (PayPal's webhook signature verification is trickier — async verification via certificate endpoint)
5. **Document edge cases**: refunds, disputes, subscription pauses, partial captures

**Reference implementations from real WP plugins:**
- Give (Stripe integration): https://github.com/impress-org/givewp
- Simple Pay Pro (Stripe): https://github.com/wpsimplepay
- WP-PayPal plugin examples

**Testing checklist before release:**
- [ ] Test mode one-time payment → credits added
- [ ] Test mode subscription creation → credits added
- [ ] Test mode subscription renewal → credits added on each cycle
- [ ] Webhook signature rejection (invalid signature → 401)
- [ ] Duplicate webhook delivery → no double topup
- [ ] Subscription cancellation → no further topups
- [ ] Refund in Stripe dashboard → option to auto-deduct credits
- [ ] Production keys work identically
