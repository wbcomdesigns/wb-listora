# WordPress Plugin QA Catalog (ALL plugins — normative)

> The single source of truth for **what gets checked, how, and in what order**
> before any card moves to Ready for Testing or any release ships. Applies to
> every Wbcom plugin/theme (100+). Per-plugin repos hold **data only**; the
> process is defined here, once. Each plugin keeps a synced copy at
> `docs/standards/qa-catalog.md`.

## Priority (non-negotiable)

**Tier 1 is presentation & functional flow — what a site owner or member SEES
and DOES in a real browser.** Code audits (WPCS, PHPStan, PHPUnit, coding rules)
are SECONDARY: they run automatically at commit/push, cost zero attention, and
never substitute for a browser pass. Rationale: the Eventonomy 2026-07-02 cycle
produced 17 QA bounces — every one was presentation or flow (theme-fit, dead UI,
SSR↔JS drift, missing entry points); zero were static-analysis catchable. Static
gates were already green the whole time.

```
Tier 1  PRESENTATION & FLOW   (browser — the primary gate)
Tier 2  PRODUCT COMPLETENESS  (no dead UI, 3 entry points, honest upsell)
Tier 3  FUNCTIONAL LOGIC      (REST live, money, roles, scale)
Tier 4  CONTRACT & WIRING     (settings, hooks, REST↔JS, enums)
Tier 5  CODE QUALITY          (secondary — automatic, silent when green)
Tier 6  I18N · DOCS · RELEASE
```

## The one pipeline (wired — every check has a named runner)

One entry point runs everything in order and emits one verdict. No step is
optional; a SKIPPED without written reason = FAIL.

├─ 2  PRODUCT COMPLETENESS
│     2a  Click-everything   every visible tab/button/setting clicked once —

│     2b  3 entry points     every data store: frontend + admin view + REST

│     4b  Key/hook contract  /wp-contract-audit (+ baseline): orphan keys,

## Gates

| Gate | Trigger | Runs | Attention needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | pre-commit | 0-boot(lint/build) + 5a/5b | none (automatic) |
| G2 | pre-push hook | Tier 4 + 5 (all static) | none (automatic) |
| **G3** | **before ANY card → Ready for Testing** | **Tiers 0–4 (browser included) for touched surfaces; full run per release cycle** | **the primary human/agent gate** |
| G4 | /wp-plugin-release | everything incl. Tier 6 | release owner |

**RFT rule:** no card moves to Ready for Testing unless Tier 1+2 passed in a
real browser for the surfaces it touched. "Static green" is never a reason to
move a card.

**Verifying a card already IN Ready for Testing is a different job** — this
pipeline asks "is the plugin healthy?", QA asks "is this specific claim true,
and did fixing it break something else?" That protocol is
[`wp-card-qa`](rft-verification.md) (regular, per-card QA — its own skill): five questions per card, a
comparable verdict format, and the owner-vs-end-user judgement call.

**Regression rule:** every QA bounce = a missing check. The fix commit MUST add
the journey step/assertion that would have caught it. A recurring bug is a
process failure.

## Per-plugin data files (the only thing a plugin owns)

```
docs/qa/qa-config.json     # site URL, themes, roles, key pages, block list  → scaffolded by /wp-plugin-release-qa
audit/journeys/**/*.md     # runnable walkthroughs (customer/member/admin/security)
audit/manifest.json        # inventory (generated by /wp-plugin-onboard)
audit/ROLE_MATRIX.md       # expected allow/deny per role
plan/INVARIANTS.yaml       # architecture gates
```

`/wp-plugin-onboard`'s bootstrap chain scaffolds these for every plugin it
touches — rollout to the portfolio happens as we work plugins, no big-bang.
The pipeline itself is never copied into a repo.

## Verdict

Every G3/G4 run writes `audit/READINESS.md`: one line per pipeline step —
PASS / FAIL / N-A(reason) / SKIPPED(reason, counts as FAIL). The Basecamp RFT
comment links this verdict. `wppqa_readiness` / `wppqa_certify` provide the
machine-readable equivalent.
