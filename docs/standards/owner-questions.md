# Owner Questions — the QA question bank (ALL plugins and themes)

> **QA stands where the site owner stands.** Owners never read code. They judge a
> plugin or theme by its options, its defaults, its templates, its emails, and
> whether the thing they bought does the thing they bought it for. Every
> question here is one an owner could ask — and answer — without opening a file.
>
> **This file grows.** Every bounce, every reopened card, every "how did QA miss
> that" adds one question, tagged with the card that paid for it. Never delete a
> question; retire it with a strike and the reason. Questions are cited by id in
> verdicts (`Questions asked: O-3 O-7 T-2`) so coverage is auditable per card.

Each question has: **id · the question · how an owner would check · what counts
as evidence.** `OWNER_INVENTORY.md` (generated) feeds the O/T/E/D/A lists;
`CORE_PATHS.md` (confirmed) feeds C.

---

## O — Options & settings

| id | Question | Check as the owner | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| O-1 | Does every setting do what its label says? | Toggle it, reload the frontend, look | Before/after screenshot |
| O-2 | Is every default the one a fresh owner would expect? | Fresh install, read each default, ask "would I change this on day one?" | Inventory default column vs judgement |
| O-3 | When a setting is off, is the feature *gone* — not just hidden? | Turn off, then hit the URL / REST / shortcode directly | Direct hit returns nothing or a clean denial |
| O-4 | Can the owner tell the current state without reading the database? | Look at the settings screen only | State visible on screen |
| O-5 | Does a saved setting survive an update, a migration, a theme switch? | Save, bump version / switch theme, re-read | Value unchanged |
| O-6 | Is a setting that exists in code reachable from an admin screen? (three-entry-points rule) | Inventory: option with reads but no admin string | Every own option has a UI or a documented reason |
| O-7 | Do dependent settings hide or explain themselves when their parent is off? | Turn parent off, look at children | Children hidden/disabled, or a note |
| O-8 | Does the setting name match the frontend wording? | Compare settings label to what members see | Same vocabulary |

## T — Templates & display

| id | Question | Check as the owner | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| T-1 | Does it look right on a theme we did not write? | Twenty Twenty-Five + one classic theme | Screenshots on both |
| T-2 | Can the owner override a template from their theme? | Inventory: theme-override loader yes/no | Copy a template to the theme, see it used |
| T-3 | Does every shipped template render without the plugin's own CSS being special-cased? | Disable theme-specific CSS, look | Layout holds |
| T-4 | Does it hold at 390px, and in RTL? | Resize; `?lang=ar` or RTL plugin | Screenshots |
| T-5 | Does it honour the theme's colours / dark mode rather than hard-coding? | Switch theme palette / dark toggle | No raw hex bleed |
| T-6 | Are empty, loading and error states designed — not blank? | Empty site, slow network, forced failure | Three screenshots |
| T-7 | Does every plugin-created page have the site chrome (header/footer/menu) on block AND classic themes? | Visit each activation page on both | Chrome present |

## E — Emails & notifications

| id | Question | Check as the owner | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| E-1 | What emails does this send, and when? Can the owner list them? | Inventory email table vs. any settings screen | A list the owner can see |
| E-2 | Does each email fire exactly once per trigger? | Trigger, check mail log | One entry |
| E-3 | Can the owner edit subject and body without code? | Look for a template/settings surface | Editable, or a filter documented |
| E-4 | Does the email say who it is from, and does the from-address match the site? | Read the headers | Site name + admin email |
| E-5 | Are in-app notifications (BuddyPress / Woo / own) cleared when acted on? | Act on the item, check the bell | Count drops |
| E-6 | Does a notification link land on the thing it names, as the right role? | Click it as the recipient | Lands correctly |

## D — Developer-friendliness

| id | Question | Check as the owner's developer | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-1 | Is there a hook on every core path (before/after save, before render, on output)? | Inventory hooks vs CORE_PATHS | Each core path names its hooks |
| D-2 | Is every own hook documented with `@since` and its args? | Inventory documented count | Undocumented list is empty or justified |
| D-3 | Can a developer change a default without editing the plugin? | Look for a `*_default(s)` filter | Filter exists |
| D-4 | Are hook names consistent with the prefix and readable? | Scan the list | No orphans, no typos |
| D-5 | Do REST endpoints exist for everything the UI can do? (three entry points) | Inventory REST count vs UI actions | Parity, or documented gaps |
| D-6 | Is there a CLI for the bulk things (seed, migrate, recount)? | `wp <prefix>` | Commands exist |

## A — Activation & lifecycle

| id | Question | Check as the owner | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| A-1 | On a clean activate, what appears? Pages, menus, roles, tables — and is each expected? | Inventory activation table; visit the site | Nothing surprising |
| A-2 | Does deactivate leave the site clean, and uninstall remove data (with a warning)? | Deactivate; uninstall on a scratch site | No orphan pages/menus; uninstall confirms |
| A-3 | Does an upgrade from the previous version keep existing data rendering? | Upgrade a seeded old site | Old content shows |
| A-4 | Does the setup wizard / first-run notice lead somewhere useful, and dismiss for good? | Activate, follow it, dismiss, reload | Gone, and stays gone |
| A-5 | Does the free/pro pair activate in either order without a fatal? | Pro first, then free; and reverse | No fatal, clear notice |

## C — Core paths (the 60–70%)

| id | Question | Check as the owner | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| C-1 | Do the ranked core paths in `CORE_PATHS.md` all complete, as their named role, on a clean install? | Walk them in rank order | One line per path, PASS/FAIL |
| C-2 | Does the first thing a new owner would try work with **zero configuration**? | Activate and try rank 1 with no settings touched | Works |
| C-3 | Is the most-used feature reachable in ≤ 2 clicks from the plugin's own landing? | Count clicks | ≤ 2 |
| C-4 | Are the core paths the ones the ledger says people actually report on? | Compare `plan/basecamp/ledger.md` hot-spots to the ranking | Ranking adjusted or justified |

## P — People (the role ladder)

| id | Question | Check | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| P-1 | Reproduced as the role that reported it? | `personas` + `?autologin=` | Verdict `Roles walked` row 1 |
| P-2 | Walked with **two** same-role members — owner and not-owner? | Two logins | Both rows |
| P-3 | Was admin the *last* rung, and never the only one? | Verdict | Admin row is the control |
| P-4 | Does `ROLE_MATRIX.md` agree with what you saw? If not, which is wrong? | Compare | Finding filed either way |

## Triage — three axes, then the priority

Answer all three for every card, in the verdict.

| Axis | Question | Values |
|---|---|---|
| **R — Reach** | Reproduces on a clean install, default settings, default theme? | `universal` · `site-specific` (only with their theme / plugin mix / config) |
| **I — Impact** | Can the owner or member complete the task? | `road-block` (no workaround) · `degraded` (partial or workaround) · `cosmetic` |
| **L — Location** | On a core path or an edge? | `core` (in CORE_PATHS) · `edge` |

| | core | edge |
|---|---|---|
| universal · road-block | **P0** | P1 |
| universal · degraded | P1 | P2 |
| site-specific · road-block | P1 | P2 |
| site-specific · degraded | P2 | P3 |
| cosmetic (either reach) | P2 | P3 |

**Site-specific is a finding, not a dismissal.** It means the product breaks on a
configuration a real owner runs. The follow-up is "which configuration, and do
we support it" — never "works for me".

**Edge cases are welcome, never first.** Walk C before anything marked edge.

## Growing this file

When a card is bounced, reopened, or a customer finds what QA did not:

1. Write the question that would have caught it, in the owner's words.
2. Give it the next id in its section, and tag it: `(card 10263273931)`.
3. Put the check in the "as the owner" column — if the check needs code, it is
   the wrong question; find the owner-visible symptom instead.
4. Sync the copy in every plugin's `docs/standards/` at its next release.

## Added 2026-09-09 — from the WPMediaVerse 2.4.x cycle

| id | Question | Check as the owner | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| T-8 | Is anything meant to be hidden still visible on a theme that ships **no** `[hidden]` reset? *(card 10266317652 — Reign/BuddyX silently rescued it; Astra did not)* | On Astra or Twenty Twenty-Five, every element with `hidden` must have `offsetParent === null` | List of hidden-but-visible elements, per theme |
| O-9 | If a setting holds a value that used to be legal and no longer is, does the feature fall back **visibly**, or fail silent? *(card P6 — `feed_layout='default'` disabled the feed with no message)* | Set each enum option to a retired value, reload | Fallback shown, or an admin notice |
| P-5 | To a role that is denied an item, does it look **identical** to an item that does not exist — same status, same page? *(2026-08-11 F2 — a denied document returned a 403 login page, confirming it existed)* | Request a denied id and a nonexistent id as `member-other` and as anonymous | Same status code, same body |
| C-5 | Before writing CANNOT-REPRO, does every fixture the repro depends on actually resolve? *(card 10264236711 — "cannot reproduce" was a deleted-media fixture)* | Confirm the row exists, the slug is live, the user is the stated role | Fixture check listed in the verdict, or BLOCKED |

## Added 2026-09-09 — admin state contract and promises (from external QA feedback)

| id | Question | Check as the owner | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| O-10 | Does every settings screen with nothing configured say what to do **next**, rather than showing an empty shell? | Fresh install, open each admin page | A next action (button or link) on every empty screen |
| O-11 | Is every field label a real label - not a placeholder that vanishes on focus, not the option key? | Tab through each form | Labels persist; none read like `mvs_foo_bar` |
| O-12 | When a save fails, is the error on the **field** that failed, not a page-level banner? | Submit an invalid value | Inline field error, focus moved to it |
| M-1 | Does every promise the readme or marketing makes ("reversible", "never leaves your server", "owner can always get back in") hold as a walked row? | `owner-inventory.py` lists promise candidates; confirm each into `promises[]` in qa-config | One row per promise, PASS with evidence |
| M-2 | Is every artefact that exists in code alive on the site - shortcode renders, block renders, route answers, admin page loads? | `owner-inventory.py --json`, then walk | `coverage.code_to_live` with no `missing-from-live` left unexplained |
| T-9 | Have the controls that only render under a **condition** (a first-visit prompt, a banner, an empty state, a cover-less card) been measured too, not just the always-visible ones? *(card 10266320513's sweep said "0 under the floor"; the profile-prompt close was 17×22 — it only renders for a member with no profile)* | Walk as a fresh member with nothing configured; measure every control that appears | Conditional controls listed in the sweep |
| T-10 | After a client-side rewrite of a notice (success becoming error), can the member still dismiss it? *(card 10322935144 — server-rendered error has ×; a failed claim `replaceChildren` wipes it, so a Stripe return with an unknown session is stuck again)* | Return with `?wbcom_credits=success&session_id=cs_test_unknown`, wait for the claim to fail | Dismiss control still present, clickable, and the URL cleans |
| M-3 | Is an **absence** the inventory reports actually absent, or just ungreppable? *(2026-09-09: "theme-override loader: NO" became a filed card; the loader existed and was documented — `locate_template()` built its argument from variables, so a literal-only grep saw nothing)* | Prove absence live before filing: exercise the thing the tool says is missing. Drop the file, call the hook, set the option | The live attempt, and its result, in the card |
| P-6 | Was the probe itself valid? A single PHP process that **writes state then reads it back** proves nothing about cached reads — the repository's request cache survives `wp_cache_flush()`. *(2026-09-09: happened twice in one session. `exists()` returned true for a row deleted moments earlier, hiding a real bug; `can_view()` returned YES for anonymous on private media, inventing a P0 that did not exist.)* | Set up in one process, read in a **separate** process. One `wp eval` per read. | The verdict names how many processes the probe used |
| P-7 | Was an admin-UI claim checked in a **real browser session**, or simulated? `wp eval` with `do_action('admin_menu')` does not register what an actual wp-admin request registers. *(2026-09-09: a CLI enumeration reported "zero admin screens"; the browser showed nine. The card was still valid, but the evidence would have sent a developer hunting a missing menu.)* | Log in as the role and load the page. For access claims, request each URL with that user's cookie and confirm the session identity on the response | The verdict names the browser/HTTP method, and the identity it confirmed |
| S-1 | Is the finding **inside the plugin's scope**? A plugin owns its own routes, templates, options, tables and REST surface. It does **not** own the site's nav menus, the theme's markup, another plugin's data, or the server config. | Name the thing that would change. If it belongs to the theme, the site owner, or another plugin, the finding is context for a verdict — not a card against us | The card names a file or surface the plugin owns |
| P-8 | For a **CSS state** claim (`:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`), was the state triggered by a **real pointer/keyboard**? A dispatched `mouseover`/`mouseenter` does not trigger CSS `:hover` — the element never matches, so nothing changes and the probe looks like a pass. *(2026-09-09: a synthetic hover reported "no jitter" before a real hover confirmed it.)* | Use the driver's own hover/focus, then assert `el.matches(':hover')` before reading geometry | The verdict shows the `:hover` assertion and the before/after geometry |
| C-6 | When a feature **hides** something, is it hidden on **every** route — listing, permalink, direct file/serve URL, REST, feed — or only on the one surface the feature happened to touch? *(2026-09-09, card 10278781363: the report auto-hide set `moderation_status='flagged'`; the explore listing filtered it out because that one caller opted in, while the permalink and the signed serve URL both returned 200 to a logged-out visitor with the full image.)* | After triggering the hide, request the item **anonymously** on each route in turn. A visibility rule that lives in the caller will be missed by exactly one caller — put the guard in the shared visibility path and re-walk | Status code and body per route, anonymous, after the hide |
| P-9 | Does the card assume a threshold/default the product does not actually use? A "does nothing on the first X" report is usually an N-threshold working correctly. | Read the option and its registered default before calling the behaviour wrong; then drive the flow N times to prove the threshold fires | The default, its admin location, and the run that crossed it |
| P-10 | Was a state-change probe contaminated by **state that already existed**? Reusing an entity created before the setting changed can bypass the very gate under test. *(2026-09-09, card 10281289161: a DM appeared to bypass a followers-only restriction; the pair already had an open conversation from before the setting was set, and an open thread stays open by design. Deleting it and re-running gave the correct `request_pending`.)* | Delete or recreate the entity so the guarded path is the one actually taken; check creation timestamps against the moment the setting changed | The verdict names the pre-existing state that was cleared |
| P-11 | Did the probe sample the DOM **while the message was still on screen**? A toast that auto-dismisses or a view that reloads will read as "nothing was shown" if sampled once, late. *(2026-09-09, card 10280477806: a duplicate-upload warning was reported missing; the modal shows it, then reloads 2.5s later. A single check at 4s saw an empty page.)* | Poll from the moment of the action (150ms interval), or freeze the reload, before concluding nothing rendered | The polling interval and the captured text |
| P-12 | For a **contrast or colour** claim, was the measured node the one that actually **paints the text**? A container whose text lives in a child that sets its own colour has a `color` that never reaches the screen. *(2026-09-09, card 10263186020: `h1.site-title` computed `rgb(32,38,46)` against a dark header — a reported 1.01:1 — but it had zero direct text nodes; the `<a>` inside it painted at 13.13:1 and the title was plainly readable in a screenshot.)* | Assert the node has direct text (`[...el.childNodes].some(n=>n.nodeType===3&&n.textContent.trim())`) before measuring it; otherwise measure the descendant that does. Composite every semi-transparent background layer down before computing the ratio — an `alpha 0.12` tint read as opaque produces a wrong number in the other direction | The painting node named, its direct-text assertion, and a screenshot |
| P-13 | Did the probe authenticate the way the **product** does? A bare `fetch()` from a logged-in page sends cookies but **no `X-WP-Nonce`**, so the WP REST API treats it as logged-out — and a permission-shaped result then looks like a data-shaped one. *(2026-09-09, card 10285755501: a raw fetch of `/wp/v2/users` returned `[]` for the ADMIN too, which read as "that user does not exist"; re-run through the app's own `restFetch` it returned 1 for admin and 0 for a subscriber — isolating a `list_users` capability gap.)* | Call through the app's own authenticated helper, or attach the nonce. When a role differential is the claim, run the identical call as both roles in the same way | The helper used, and the same call's result per role |
| P-14 | For a "does this control disappear once state changes?" claim, did the check include a **fresh page load in the changed state**? An action's own success handler usually writes the new state into client memory, so the control hides for the rest of that session whether or not the server ever says so. Acting then looking is the one path where the bug cannot appear. *(2026-09-10, card 10285886066: I registered for a tournament through the UI, saw the Register button hide, and closed the card CANNOT-REPRO. `register()` had populated an in-memory `registeredIds` array; the detail page's endpoint - `get_bracket()` - never returned `viewer_registered` at all, so on a hard load as an already-registered member the button came back. The reporter was right and my verdict was wrong.)* | Put the account into the changed state **out of band** - a service call, a DB write, a second browser session - then load the page cold. Verify the control both ways: hidden for the changed account, still offered to an unchanged one | The state was set out of band, the load was cold, and both the case and the control are reported |
| P-15 | Does the **endpoint this screen actually calls** carry the field the UI needs, or only its siblings? A resource with several read routes will grow a field on the ones someone was looking at and not on the rest. *(Same card: `get_items()` and `get_item()` both returned `viewer_registered`; `get_bracket()`, the one the detail page fetches, did not - and its docblock already claimed it returned what the Register button needed.)* | Call the exact route the page uses, as the affected user, and look for the field - not a neighbouring route that looks equivalent. Check the nesting too: the field may be one level down | The route, the user, and the field's value quoted from that response |
